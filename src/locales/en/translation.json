  "history-summary-point-1": "In January 2017, a group of students at Florida Tech recognized the absence of a close-knit campus community for engineering students. They desired an organization that would foster personal and professional growth while accommodating both genders. Discovering the values of Theta Tau, a national co-ed engineering fraternity, they decided to establish a local fraternity called Zeta Theta Tau. With 10 core members, they organized social and professional development events during their first semester.",
  "history-summary-point-2": "During the following semester, the fraternity expanded its membership and engaged in service and social activities. They collaborated with other campus organizations, volunteered for Engineers' Week, and conducted a beach cleanup. Social events such as game and movie nights, beach days, and a trip to Disney strengthened the bond among members. Simultaneously, they submitted a petition to become a colony of Theta Tau.",
  "history-summary-point-3": "In August 2018, the Florida Institute of Technology Colony of Theta Tau was certified with 15 founders. They welcomed new pledge classes, hosted events, and began establishing connections with Theta Tau brothers from various regions. However, their journey faced challenges when the COVID-19 pandemic hit in March 2020. Despite the difficulties, the fraternity adapted and persisted, using virtual platforms like Minecraft to stay connected and continue their activities.",
  "history-summary-point-4": " As the pandemic continued into the Fall 2020 semester, the chapter planned a combination of virtual and carefully planned in-person events, focusing on community service, meme contests, and virtual workshops for professional development. They maintained connections with alumni and other Theta Tau chapters through online interactions. ",
  "history-summary-point-5": "Throughout the Spring 2021 semester, the colony thrived by hosting virtual movie and game nights, organizing hiking trips, and providing professional development opportunities to the student body. They actively participated in regional conferences and fostered communication with the Zeta Gamma chapter. In June 2021, the colony's petition for chapter status was approved at the Theta Tau National Convention, and they became a chapter-elect. ",
  "history-summary-point-6": "Looking forward, the chapter-elect anticipates their official installation as Psi Epsilon chapter and played a role in persuading the university to recognize them as a professional fraternity. With the COVID-19 situation improving, the fraternity envisions becoming a close campus community where engineering students can live, learn, and grow together.",
